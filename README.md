## Implementation guidelines

- Follow best practices, for example TDD/BDD, with a focus on full-stack testing.
- Prioritize correctness, robustness, and extensibility over extra features and optimizations.
- Write code with the quality bar one would expect to see in production.
- Try to simplify by using open source frameworks and libraries where possible.
